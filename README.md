# NumericMethodsProject
Numeric Methods - Project to pass the semester

The project was written in Polish. The PDF file is also written in Polish.

The project consisted in data visualization, determination of: interpolation and approximation
functions, mean, median, standard deviation, surface area, integrals of interpolation and
approximation functions, partial derivatives and determination of monotonicity for previously
selected points.

There are functions written in the Octave files that allow you to include some required functions in the project.
In contrast, the entire computation application is in the C ++ file. The PDF contains a breakdown of everything.
